# 📦 FMCG Data Engineering Pipeline – AtliKon

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an **end-to-end data engineering pipeline** for an **FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods)** business use case.  
The pipeline integrates data from **parent and child companies**, processes both **full and incremental loads**, and produces **analytics-ready tables** for dashboarding.

The solution is designed using **real-world data engineering best practices** such as layered architecture, incremental ingestion, and modular notebook-based processing on **Databricks**.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
AtliKon, an FMCG organization, receives sales, customer, product, and pricing data from multiple operational sources:

- **Parent Company**: Provides dimension and fact data
- **Child Company**: Sends daily incremental order data

Challenges addressed:
- Handling **high-volume daily transactional data**
- Supporting **incremental fact loads**
- Maintaining **clean, analytics-ready dimensions**
- Enabling **business dashboards** for decision-making

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
The pipeline follows a **Bronze → Silver → Gold** layered design:

- **Bronze (Raw)**  
  - Full load and incremental CSV data from parent & child companies
- **Silver (Cleaned & Standardized)**  
  - Validated dimensions and fact tables
- **Gold (Analytics Layer)**  
  - Denormalized tables for dashboarding and reporting

Architecture and design diagrams are available in the `resources/` folder.

## 🗂️ Raw Data (Bronze Layer)

The Bronze layer contains **raw, unprocessed CSV data** received from upstream source systems.  
These datasets are **intentionally excluded from version control** and documented here to reflect **enterprise data engineering best practices**.

Raw data is organized by **source company** and **load type (full vs incremental)**.

## 📌 Data Sources & Load Types

| Source Company | Dataset Type | Load Type |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Parent Company | Dimensions & Facts | Full Load |
| Child Company  | Orders | Incremental Load |

---

## 👤 Customers (Raw)

**Source:** Parent & Child Company  
**Load Type:** Full Load  
**Description:** Master data representing customer details.

| Column Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| customer_id | Unique customer identifier |
| customer_name | Customer name |
| region | Sales region |
| channel | Sales channel |

---

## 📦 Products (Raw)

**Source:** Parent & Child Company  
**Load Type:** Full Load  
**Description:** Product master data used for sales analysis.

### 📄 Sample Raw Order Data

| order_id | customer_id | product_id | order_date  | quantity | gross_price |
|---------:|-------------|------------|-------------|---------:|------------:|
| 10001    | C101        | P501       | 2025-09-01  | 2        | 120.50      |
| 10002    | C104        | P203       | 2025-09-01  | 1        | 75.00       |
